# JavaScript Class 1 Notes

## 1. History of JavaScript

* The company **Netscape Communications Corporation** wanted to develop its own web browser.
* Initially, they tried to integrate **Java** into the browser. But Java was not ideal for frontend development as browsers require a more dynamic and lightweight language.
* So, **Brendan Eich**, an employee at Netscape, created a new language in 1993 called **Mocha** (considered the worldâ€™s first browser scripting language).
* Later, the name *Mocha* was changed to **Mosaic**, and then renamed again to **LiveScript** in 1994.
* In 1995, they officially released the **LiveScript** language along with the browser **Netscape Navigator** (the worldâ€™s second web browser).
* However, LiveScript didnâ€™t gain popularity. So, Netscape renamed it to **JavaScript** for marketing purposes, leveraging the popularity of Java.
* The **Netscape Navigator** browser became very popular, and JavaScript started gaining attention.
* Meanwhile, **Microsoft** copied around 70% of JavaScriptâ€™s features and added 30% of their own. They named it **JScript** and launched it with their own browser called **Internet Explorer** in **1995** (the worldâ€™s third browser).

## âœ… 2. Emergence of JavaScript

* Initially created to enhance interactivity within the browser (client-side scripting).
* Became the **standard scripting language for browsers**.
* Later standardized by **ECMA International** in 1997 (as ECMAScript).
* Evolved to be used both on **frontend** and **backend** (via Node.js).

---

## âœ… 3. How JavaScript Became Popular

* Lightweight and easy to integrate into HTML.
* Became the **only scripting language supported by all major browsers**.
* Community support, frequent updates via **ECMAScript versions (ES5, ES6, etc.)**.
* Rise of frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) and backend (Node.js) boosted its usage.
* Runs directly in the browser â€“ **no compilation needed**.

## âœ… 4. Flow of JavaScript Code in VS Code

* JavaScript files are usually saved with `.js` extension.
* JavaScript code is written in files or embedded directly into HTML using the `<script>` tag.
* When run in the browser:

  1. The HTML is parsed first (top to bottom).
  2. `<script>` tags are encountered and JS is executed immediately unless `defer` or `async` is used.
* In **VS Code**, we usually:

  * Write code in `.js` files.
  * Use **Live Server extension** to see the output dynamically in a browser.

##  5. `defer` vs `async` in `<script>` Tag

| Attribute | Load Order        | Execution Timing                            | Best Use Case                                |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `defer`   | Loads in parallel | Executes **after HTML parsing is complete** | Multiple scripts that depend on DOM elements |
| `async`   | Loads in parallel | Executes **as soon as it's loaded**         | Independent scripts (e.g., analytics)        |

**Example:**

```html
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
```

---

##  6. Order of Execution When Using Multiple `<script>` Tags

* **Without `async` or `defer`**:

  * Scripts are executed **in the order they appear** in the HTML (top to bottom).
  * HTML parsing **pauses** for script execution.

* **With `defer`**:

  * All deferred scripts are downloaded in parallel.
  * Execution happens **in order**, after HTML parsing is complete.

* **With `async`**:

  * Scripts are downloaded in parallel.
  * Executed **as soon as ready**, **not guaranteed in order**.

### Example:

```html
<!-- Executed in order, blocks HTML parsing -->
<script src="a.js"></script>
<script src="b.js"></script>

<!-- Executed after HTML parsing, in order -->
<script src="c.js" defer></script>
<script src="d.js" defer></script>

<!-- Executed as soon as loaded, order not guaranteed -->
<script src="e.js" async></script>
<script src="f.js" async></script>
```

## âœ… 7. What is a Module?

* A **module** is a JavaScript file that can **export** values (functions, variables, classes) to be used in another file.
* Helps in code organization and reusability.

**Example:**

**math.js**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**main.js**

```js
import { add } from './math.js';
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

> Note: To use modules, you must use `type="module"` in your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```
